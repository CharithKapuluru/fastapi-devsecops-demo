# Trivy ignore patterns
# Use this file to suppress known/accepted vulnerabilities

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# Base image vulnerabilities are EXPECTED and NORMAL for python:3.12-slim
# These are vulnerabilities in the Debian base OS that:
# 1. May not affect our application (no code path to exploit)
# 2. Are waiting for upstream Debian/Python patches
# 3. Are assessed as low-risk for our use case
#
# This is standard in production - you document and accept known risks
# rather than blocking deployments for vulnerabilities you can't fix.

# Example: Ignore specific CVEs (uncomment to use)
# CVE-2024-12345  # Brief explanation of why it's safe to ignore
# CVE-2024-67890  # E.g., "Affects package X which we don't use"

# For now, we're NOT ignoring any CVEs
# All findings will be visible in GitHub Security tab for transparency
# Recruiters can see we're aware of security, not hiding issues
